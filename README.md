## 🚀 About

**Nyxo.js** is a next-generation Discord bot framework that combines enterprise-grade features with developer-friendly
design. Built from the ground up with TypeScript, it offers unmatched type safety, modular architecture, and advanced
performance optimizations.

Unlike other Discord libraries, Nyxo.js is designed for **scalable applications** that demand reliability,
maintainability, and professional-grade features.

## 🌙 Why "Nyxo.js"?

The name **Nyxo** is inspired by **Nyx**, the Greek goddess of the night, symbolizing mystery, power, and elegance.  
The suffix **-o** adds a modern and dynamic touch, reflecting the framework's ambition: to provide a powerful, smooth,
and innovative solution for building Discord bots with TypeScript.

Thus, **Nyxo.js** embodies both the depth and sophistication of the night and the modernity of a tool designed for
today's developers.
