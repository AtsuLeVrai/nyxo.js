## 🌙 Why "Nyxo"?

The name **Nyxo** is inspired by **Nyx**, the Greek goddess of the night, symbolizing mystery, power, and elegance.  
The suffix **-o** adds a modern and dynamic touch, reflecting the library's ambition: to provide a powerful, smooth, and innovative solution for Discord bot development.
