## ⏸️ Project Status: Archived

**This project has reached its natural conclusion.** After extensive development and architectural exploration, Nyxo.js is being archived as its creator has moved on to explore new horizons beyond the Discord ecosystem.

*Sometimes the greatest achievement is knowing when a chapter has ended and a new one is ready to begin.*

The codebase remains available for educational purposes and community forking.

## What Nyxo.js Was

Nyxo.js was a TypeScript Discord library focused on memory efficiency and reliability for large-scale applications.

**Core Design Philosophy:**

- Low memory footprint through intelligent caching
- Advanced rate limiting with circuit breaker protection
- Complete TypeScript coverage with strict null safety
- ESM-only modern architecture

---

## Final State

**Last Active Development:** 2025

**What Was Completed:**

- REST API foundation with sophisticated rate limiting
- Intelligent caching system with LRU/TTL algorithms
- Circuit breaker resilience patterns
- Robust TypeScript architecture and build system

**What Remained In Progress:**

- Complete Discord API coverage
- WebSocket Gateway implementation
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

---

## Technical Legacy

Built for applications that needed:

- Predictable memory usage at enterprise scale
- Reliable handling of Discord API rate limits
- Type-safe Discord API interactions
- Production-grade error handling and resilience

**Architecture Lessons:**

- Performance-first design decisions
- Memory-conscious caching strategies
- Resilience patterns for external API dependencies
- Modern TypeScript best practices

---

## For Future Maintainers

This project represented a deep exploration into high-performance Discord library architecture. The codebase contains valuable patterns for:

- **Rate limiting** implementation with backoff strategies
- **Memory management** in long-running Node.js applications
- **Circuit breaker** patterns for API reliability
- **TypeScript** architecture for large-scale libraries

Feel free to learn from, fork, or continue this work if it aligns with your goals.
